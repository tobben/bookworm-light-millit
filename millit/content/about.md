I've been working as a consultant for almost ten years. I started out in 2012 - right after my graduation from the Royal Institute of Technology where I studied Master of Science in Media Technology.

Some people are allergic to the words "full stack" - but thats what I truly do, and also like to do. I do React, I do .NET, I do stored procedures and everything in between. More or less. Always with focus on quality and deliverability. It's still great fun and I learn new things every day. For example: When I built this website. I wanted to try out Hugo, and my company needs at least some kind of website, sooo... Here we are. Maybe fill it with more content some day.

I think you're probably interested in my professional experience - LinkedIn are your friend in that case. Please find my profile in the footer of this page.
